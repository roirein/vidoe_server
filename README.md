to run the code locally ffmpeg should be installed on the local machine,
the packeges express, pageres, videoshow and valid-url should be installed,

to run it you need in the cmd type node app.js or npm run start from the project directory
then you can go on your browser to localhost:4000 and send urls from there.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints of the exam period i didn't make the bonus
